## The Economic Role of the Picayune

The Spanish picayune coin, valued at 6¼ cents (or half a Spanish real), played a significant role in the colonial economies of Louisiana and Florida. As a small-denomination coin, it facilitated daily transactions for common goods and services. Its value was tied to the Spanish real, with 8 reales equaling one Spanish dollar, making the picayune a convenient fractional currency. After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the picayune continued to circulate alongside American currency until it was gradually phased out.
